This is a green project ment to encourage people to recycle more and be more awere of the way we handle our waste.
This repository contains every file needed to build the prototype we have made.
These files include:
* **Android app**  meant to scan recyclable products barcodes and communicate with an Arduino telling him which recycling bin he should open.
* **Arduino Sketch** meant to control the servo motor bluetooth module and leds.
* **Solid 3d file** A 3d model of the recyclyng can we used to print the prototype made in solid.
* **The Show Case files** The files we used to pitch the idea infront of an audiance.
